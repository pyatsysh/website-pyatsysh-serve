Hi, I'm Peter and I live in London. I'm a theoretical physicist, migrated into machine learning. My main research interests are applied probability and computational statistics. I am currently a research associate at The Alan Turing Institute, working with [Andrew Duncan](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/andrew-duncan) on scalable methods for statistical inference and machine learning.

Before that I worked in classical statistical mechanics of soft matter, developing models of interface motion and phase transitions. I did my PhD at Imperial College in the area of computational methods for PDEs, arising in classical density functional theory. My supervisor was [Serafim Kalliadasis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.kalliadasis).
